### V-HUD:
A work-in-progress open source Heads-up display, written for RenderWare based engines (mainly GTA: San Andreas) referencing GTA: V.
Initially thought as an attempt to reverse [GTA5 HUD by DK22Pac](https://gtaforums.com/topic/652697-gta5-hud-by-dk22pac/) HUD modification, has been soon rewritten and enhanced where possible.

As it's still a WIP project, it's not recommended for end user. 
A download link will appear as soon as the project enter it's beta stage.
